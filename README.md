# EnSciComp-edia

This is a repository to build a categorical encyclopedia of all the topics ever taught in Scientific Computings Course.

I'll be following the four principles of ISAD(G):
- Descrpition proceeeding form the general to the specific
- Information should be relevant to the level of descrpition
- Descriptions should be linked between levels
- Non-repetition of information
