# EnSciComp-edia

This is a repository to build a categorical encyclopedia of all the topics ever taught in Scientific Computings Course.



The First Fond:
- Numerical Methods


Stuff to write:

-Tiltes  
-Creators  
-Dates  
-How much material is there  
-Genres/Themes  
-Types of files  
-Source/Refernces  

Talk about any restrictions on access/reproduction   
Size of the files  

Problably a good idea to have a ipynb file for every .py file and vice versa.


I'll be following the four principles of ISAD(G):  
- Descrpition proceeeding form the general to the specific  
- Information should be relevant to the level of descrpition  
- Descriptions should be linked between levels  
- Non-repetition of information  

I'll also try to not forget the essentioal elements for international exchange of information and gather as many data elements i can for every item.
